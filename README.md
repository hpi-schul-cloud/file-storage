# File Storage Service

This project provides a file storage service with integrated antivirus scanning, authorization, and preview generation. It is designed for use in secure environments and supports integration with external services such as S3-compatible storage, antivirus servers, and authorization APIs.

## Features

- **File Upload & Download**: Securely upload and download files.
- **Antivirus Integration**: Files with Preview are scanned for viruses before being stored.
- **Authorization**: Access is controlled via an external authorization API.
- **Preview Generation**: Supports generating previews for supported file types. It needs ImageMagick installed on the system.
- **Logging**: Detailed logging for debugging and auditing.
- **RabbitMQ Integration**: For asynchronous processing and notifications.
- **MongoDB Support**: Stores file metadata.
